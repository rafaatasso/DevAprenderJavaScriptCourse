Here I will write about the classes and projects from this youtube video.

### Division

There is a folder named 'class' where I put all the notes. Inside this folder, we have another folder 'js' where the classes are divided to each class like:
- class(number)_(classname);

Each little project will have its own folder, named like:
- project(number)_(projectname);
